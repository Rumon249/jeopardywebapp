# jeopardywebapp
Our goal with this project was to create a functional good-looking game of Jeopardy using HTML, CSS, and PHP. Players will be able to login and keep an account to track their high score as they play the familiar game of Jeopardy where you answer questions for money. The higher the reward of the question, the more difficult the question is.
